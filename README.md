# Neon Snake Game 🐍✨

This is my **second project** and my **first project using JavaScript**.  
My previous project was built only with **HTML and CSS**, and with this one I stepped into **real JavaScript logic, state management, and game mechanics**.

This project helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how complete applications are structured.

## 🧠 Concepts & JavaScript Features Used

This project helped me learn and apply:

- DOM manipulation
- CSS Grid generated dynamically using JavaScript
- Game loop using `setInterval`
- Event handling (`keydown`, `click`)
- State management (gameStarted, direction, score, timer)
- Collision detection logic
- Array operations (`unshift`, `pop`, `slice`)
- Conditional rendering using CSS classes
- **localStorage** for saving high score
- Clean code structure with modular functions
